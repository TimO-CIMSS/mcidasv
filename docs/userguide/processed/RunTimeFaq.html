        <h4>Q. I couldn't download McIDAS-V. Is the server down?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> Usually an inability to download McIDAS-V
        and other Unidata software is due to a failure by your system to correctly
        identify itself to our server.
        <p> Both our server and the system trying to download Unidata software
          have a &quot;name&quot; (domain name or host name or server name) and an IP address.
          For example the address 128.117.140.62 is the same as the server with
          name unidata.ucar.edu.</p>
        <p> As a security measure many servers only reply to requests from systems
          whose address can be matched to a name using &quot;reverse lookup&quot; - turning
          the numbers into a name.</p>
        <p> &quot;Forward lookups&quot; find the IP address of any given host name. The
          reverse action is resolving IP addresses into host names. If our server
          cannot resolve the requesting system IP address into a name, no software
          will be sent to the requesting IP address. If you are having problems
          downloading McIDAS-V from our server, check with your local system
          administrator to make sure that your machine has reverse lookup enabled.
          If not, download McIDAS-V from a system that does.</p>

        <h4>Q. When I first run McIDAS-V through Web Start, it asks me to accept
          a certificate? What should I do?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> When you first download McIDAS-V through
        Web Start, you will see a message like:
        <pre>

        <h4>Q. How can I get updates through Web Start?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> When starting McIDAS-V using Web Start,
        the latest version of all McIDAS-V code is found at the UW-SSEC server,
        and it is automatically downloaded and installed if it is newer than
        the version you have on your system. </div>

          Start?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> Sometimes starting a program on a Windows
        system with Web Start will produce a dialog box that says &quot;There is no
        disk in drive A.&quot; Normally clicking the continue button will cause the
        program to start properly. </div>

      <div class="faq-question">
        <h4>Q. How do I use the Web Start Applications Manager?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> If you run McIDAS-V from Web Start, for
        more control of McIDAS-V, use the Web Start Application Manager. You
        can launch it by clicking <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/webstart/IDV/player.jnlp"> here</a>.
        Alternatively, go to http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/demos.html,
        and find the Web Start &quot;Application Manager&quot; on that page. Start the &quot;Application
        Manager&quot; by clicking on the &quot;Launch&quot; button.
        <p> In the Application Manager you will see McIDAS-V, if you do this
          after you have installed McIDAS-V with Web Start.</p>
        <p> You can use the Application Manager to start McIDAS-V without going
          to the Unidata web page Web Start link, and to remove an old McIDAS-V
          to force a complete new McIDAS-V download next time you start McIDAS-V
          with the Unidata web page http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/metapps/webstart/IDV/
          .</p>
        <p> If your Web Start McIDAS-V installation seems broken, remove it with
          the Application Manager and reload from the McIDAS-V Web Start Link.
          When you run the Application Manager it will have a panel showing &quot;McIDAS-V&quot; 
          with an icon. Click to select and it will highlight; it
          may already be selected. Use the <code class="menu">Application-&gt;Remove
          Application</code> menu. The McIDAS-V item will go away. Reload McIDAS-V
          from the Unidata web site.</p>
        <p> You can see what Java version McIDAS-V is using. Use the Application
          Manager's <code class="menu">File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java</code> menu
          and look at &quot;Product version&quot;. </p>

      <div class="faq-question">
        <h4>Q. How can I show the Java console when running with Web Start?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> When you start McIDAS-V using Web Start,
        you don't have a console window opened by default. You can enable the
        Java console through the Web Start Applications Manager. Bring up the
        Web Start Manager (Java Application Cache Viewer) as described <a href="#wsmanager">above</a>.
        Use the <code class="menu">Edit-&gt;Preferences</code> menu to bring
        up the Preferences dialog. Click on the Advanced Tab and expand the Java
        Console item in the tree. Select the &quot;Show Console&quot; option and then click
        the OK button. The next time you start McIDAS-V with Web Start, you will
        get a console that will log messages. Messages are also logged to the
        McIDAS-V console. See the item <a href="#console">below</a> for information
        on using this feature. </div>

        <h4>Q. Can I serve up JNLP bundles from my own web server?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> You can save a bundle as a JNLP file
        by using a .jnlp extension in the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save As...</code> menu
        dialog. Once you have the file, you can place it on your web server and
        create a web page that points to it. Your web server must identify this
        as a JNLP file, so if it doesn't already support this, you'll need to
        configure your Web server so that all files with the .jnlp file extension
        are set to the application/x-java-jnlp-file MIME type. Each Web server
        has a specific way in which to add MIME types. For example, for the Apache
        Web server you must add the following line to the .mime.types configuration
        file:
        <pre>
application/x-java-jnlp-file JNLP
</pre>
        Check the documentation for the specifics of your Web server. </div>

    <div class="faq-answer">I get this error message in the shell window:
<pre>
GLX version 1.3 or higher is required
The reported version number may be incorrect.&nbsp; There is a known
ATI driver bug in glXQueryVersion that incorrectly reports the GLX

run anyway.</pre></div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> First, check for the most updated video card driver. If the problem still

        <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong>GLX is an extension that must be supported by the graphics card.&nbsp; This
      error is most likely occurring because the graphics drivers for RHEL are
      not properly configured.
    <p>Assuming that the latest graphics drivers are installed, they must be
      configured in the window system configuration file. Since RHEL uses Xorg,

<div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong>If you have a firewall and are trying to get data from the remote servers
      (image, radar, point, upper air and profiler data), error messages such
      as <span class="faq-answer">&quot;</span>Error opening connection ... Operation

      these servers to send data, your firewall software must allow connections
    on ports 112 (ADDE) and 8080 (THREDDS Data Server).</div>

      <h4>Q. Drawing problems on Monitor2 of a two-monitor system</h4></div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong> </strong>If I move the McIDAS-V windows to Monitor2 of my two-monitor system,
      some things don't work correctly. For example, if I try to add a new tab
      the data display section of the main display window goes blank (<span class="faq-answer">&quot;</span>grays
      out<span class="faq-answer">&quot;</span>), or if I try to run a bundle
      it fails with, <span class="faq-answer">&quot;</span><em>Error loading

      <path and bundle file name> adding a container to a container
      on a different GraphicsDevice</em><span class="faq-answer">&quot;</span>. </div>
      <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong>Some graphics card/driver combinations don't allow these functions to
      work in Monitor2 of two-monitor systems. For now, you can simply move the
      McIDAS-V windows to Monitor1 then successfully add new tabs and run bundles.
    <p>If you are running Red Hat with a NVIDIA graphics card using TwinView

      <h4>Q. No map in the McIDAS-V Main Display Window</h4></div>
<div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> Try changing your memory to use 1 GB or lower and restart McIDAS-V. You
        can change the amount of memory used by McIDAS-V by editing the <strong>Maximum
        Heap Size</strong> in the <strong><a href="tools/preferences/AdvancedPreferences.html">Advanced</a></strong> tab of the Preferences
        by selected <strong>Edit-&gt;Preferences...</strong> from the Main Display Window.

     <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. <a class="faq-question-link" href="#white">Why do my images display white when there should be valid data?</a></h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> The first thing to do is to make sure that your graphics drivers are up to date. If this does not solve the problem, another option is to change the amount of memory allocated to McIDAS-V. From the Main Display Window's menu bar, select <strong>Edit-&gt;Preferences</strong>. This opens a User Preferences window, where you want to select the <a href="tools/preferences/AdvancedPreferences.html"><strong>Advanced</strong></a> tab. At the top of the window there are two options for selecting memory. Click the radio button that allows you to specify the numerical value of memory allocated to McIDAS-V. Enter in a value of 512 megabytes. Any changes in the Advanced User Preferences requires a restart of McIDAS-V to take effect. If this resolves the issue of white images, you can start increasing the memory until the problem appears again. Stay below the memory value that produces the problem.</div>
