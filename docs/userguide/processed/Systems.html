<div class="pagetitle">1.1 System Requirements</div>





The IDV should run on any platform that fully supports <b>Java
2</b> and <b>Java 3D</b> and has been tested on <b>Windows, Linux,
Solaris/SPARC, Mac OS-X</b>.  AIX and IRIX support the requirements in
certain configurations.</p>

<p> For reasonable performance, it is recommended that an Intel system
running IDV have at least a <b>1.2 GHz processor and 1 GB memory
(RAM)</b>. Performance will be even better with faster processors and
more memory. Detailed requirements are listed below.</p>

<a name="os"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">1.1.0 Operating Systems and Java Versions</div> 

The IDV runs on any platform that supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Java 2</b> version 1.5 or higher (non-beta versions only) <b>AND</b>
<li><b>Java 3D</b> version 1.3.1 or later.  
</ul>
<p>

The IDV is known to run on the following operating systems:<p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>OS</th><th>Version</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Windows</b></td><td>2000, XP, Vista<sup><b>(1)</b></sup></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Linux</b></td><td> Fedora Core 4, 5, 6 <sup><b>(2)</b></sup></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Mac OS-X</b></td><td> 10.3.1 or later<sup><b>(3)</b></sup></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Solaris/SPARC</b></td><td>Solaris 9+<sup><b>(4)</b></sup></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Solaris/x86</b></td><td>Solaris 10 (Intel)<sup><b><b>(5)</b></sup></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
  
If other platforms fully support Java 2 (version 1.5+) and 
Java 3D (version 1.3.1 or higher) (e.g. AIX, IRIX) , they should 
also work.

<p>

Your graphics system must support 3D; make sure you have the latest
video driver for your graphics card. This is included in the Windows
operating system. On Linux the driver must support GLX, an X windows
system extension to OpenGL programs.

<p>
<b>NOTES:</b>
<p>

<b><sup>(1)</sup></b>You must have 
Direct-X version 8.0 or higher installed on your Windows system if 
you use the Direct-X version of Java 3D.
<br>

<b><sup>(2)</sup></b>The version of the Mesa library that comes with
RedHat Linux may be incompatible with Java 3D packaged with the IDV. 
If you experience X server crashes when exiting the IDV,
you will need to build and install Mesa from source
available at <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org">
http://www.mesa3d.org</a>.

<br>

<b><sup>(3)</sup></b>Java 3D must be installed for Mac OS-X.  For version 10.4 and
higher, it comes with the system.  For previous versions, you can download
it <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/java3dandjavaadvancedimagingupdate.html">here</a>.

<br>

<b><sup>(4)</sup></b>OpenGL must be installed for Java 3D to run on Solaris/SPARC.
<br>

<b><sup>(5)</sup></b>For Solaris/x86 you must have Java 1.5 and Java 3D 1.4.0 (or later) 
installed (comes with the IDV installer, or you can install yourself) and a
compatible video card.  For more information, see:<p>

https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html
<br>

<a name="disk"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">1.1.1 Disk Space</div> 

Using Web Start, you will need about 35 megabytes of disk space for
the IDV-related JAR files downloaded. Additional space will be needed
for the installation of Java, Java 3D, and Web Start, which must be
installed on your system to run the IDV with Web Start.

<p>

Using installer files, you will need about 50 MB disk space for the
installer file, which will uncompress into about twice that size. These
include Java and Java3D.


<a name="memory"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">1.1.2 System Memory and Processor Speed</div> 

The IDV can be demanding of hardware speed and memory depending on the
size of the datasets you wish to work with. It is recommended that
the system have a <b>minimum</b> of 512 MB of RAM free for IDV use.
Performance is significantly better with 1 GB RAM or more.

<p>

Recommended processor speed will vary by platform, but an Intel Pentium
CPU with 1.2 GHz is about the minimum you would need for reasonable
performance. You can run on a system as slow as 500 MHZ or even less,
but response will be correspondingly reduced. In general, the faster
the processor, and the more memory your system has, the better IDV
performance will be.

<a name="video"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">1.1.3 Graphics Cards</div> 
The IDV works on systems with graphics cards that support OpenGL (all
systems) and Direct-X (version 8.0+, Windows only).  In most cases,
you should make sure you have the latest video driver for your system.
Even if the system is brand new, the video driver may be old.
<p>
The IDV also works on systems with stereo video cards.  See the
<a href="Faq.html">FAQ</a> on video card for more information.

<a name="network"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">1.1.4 Internet Connection for Downloading the IDV, and for Data Sources</div> 

You will have to download some 35 MB of IDV software initially if you
use the Web Start installation, or some 55 MB if you use installer
files which provide Java and Java3D.

<p>

The IDV is designed to access data on remote servers on the
Internet, as well as from local files. Downloading data from remote
servers benefits from a fast connection to the Internet, since many data
fields are large.
