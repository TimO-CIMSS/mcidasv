The WMS Control displays imagery from WMS servers.
A set of predefined links to WMS
servers for topographic, shaded relief and aerial imagery
is also provided with the Background Image control.
<p>
To use the pre-defined Background images simply select
the <code class="menu">Display-&gt;Special-&gt;Background Image</code> menu item.
To choose imagery from other web map servers
bring up the <a href="../../data/choosers/CatalogChooser.html">Data Source Chooser</a>,
go to the Catalogs tab and enter the url that points to
the <i>Capabilities</i> document of the desired WMS.
We also provide links to a set of useful WMSs from the 
<i>idvcatalog</i>. If it is not in the Catalog pull down menu
simply enter the url:
<pre>http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/georesources/idvcatalog.xml</pre>
From this catalog open the <i>Web Map Servers</i> tab
and select the WMS you would like to access.

<p>
The WMS Control makes request to the Web Map Server for an image
that covers the area currently being displayed in the main display.
Due to the time it takes to access remote servers the WMS Control 
does not request new images when the user pans and zooms.

<div class="pagesubtitle">Properties</div><ul><li><b>Layer</b><p> 
If multiple layers have been selected (using control-click in the
WMS Chooser or in the Background Image control) you can choose
which layer to view with this menu.
 <p>
<li><b>Image Buttons</b><p> 
You can reload the image from the server at the current screen location
and scale and  set the projection in the display to the current image bounds.
<p>
When the <code class="menu">Auto-Reload</code> button is selected, the 
WMS control will automatically fetch a new image every time the main display is panned or zoomed. 
There is a slight delay so
that successive zooms do not cause successive image requests.
 <p>
<li><b>Resolution</b><p> The <code class="command">Resolution</code> menu allows you to make requests for lower
resolution images. This results in a smaller image file size  and
quicker requests from the server.
 <p>
<li><b>Vertical Position</b><p> This slider allows you to set the vertical
position of the image. <p>
<li><b>Transparency</b><p> You can adjust the overall transparency of the image.
Note: Some Web Map Servers provide images that contain transparent
sections. Currently, the IDV does not support the display of transparent 
sections.
 <p>
<li><b>Dimension Scale</b><p> 
By default the bounds of the image that is retrieved from the server is the size of the display.
This slider allows you to fetch an even larger image.
 <p>
<li><b>Save as Image Xml/Kml  File</b><p> 
This is available under the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save</code> menu. It takes the most
recently displayed image and writes it out (e.g., as a jpeg file)
and also writes out the IDV's <i>ximg</i> xml file that contains
the reference to the image file and the lat/lon position of the image.
<p>
This  allows the user to load this image back in without being connected to
the original web map server.
<p>
If a <i>.kml</i> or <i>.kmz</i> file suffix is given then the Google Earth
file is created and the image can be loaded  into Google Earth.
