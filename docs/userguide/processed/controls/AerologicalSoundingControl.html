<div class="pagetitle">Sounding Display</div>
<xxxmeta xxxname="jhid" value="idv.controls.aerologicalsoundingcontrol">
<div class="pagesubtitle">Overview</div>
The meteorological sounding display is available for:
<ul>
  <li>RAOBs (balloon soundings)</li>
  <li>numerical weather prediction model output with temperature and humidity.
    The dew-point temperature is computed by internal code from temperature and
    relative humidity grids.</li>
  <li>from a local file that contains aircraft track data.</li>
</ul>
<p>To load sounding data see <a href="../quickstart/Upperair.html#connecting">Choosing
     RAOB Sounding Data from a Remote Server</a> and <a href="../quickstart/Grids.html">Plots
     from Gridded Data</a>. Sounding display includes
    an aerological (thermodynamic) diagram (e.g., skew-T, Stuve, Emagram) and
    a table of related aerological parameters, and appears in the <strong>Layer
    Controls</strong>.</p>
<p></p><a name="image1"></a>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/GridSkewTControlGui.gif"  alt="The Grid Sounding Control with a Skew-T" ><br>
<span class="caption">Image 1: The Grid Sounding Control with a Skew-T</span></div>
<p>A label at the top of the sounding window shows the latitude-longitude position
  of the sounding. The RAOB station location is shown on the main McIDAS-V display
  as a small colored square. When displaying sounding plots made from gridded
  model output, the position of the sounding is shown in the main 3D view window
  by a solid-color selector point and vertical line. You can move this model-output-based
  sounding position over the map by dragging the selector point with the left
  button.</p>
<p> When displaying a sounding diagram made from gridded numerical weather model
  output, there is a pull-down selector menu of the model output valid times
  in the upper right corner.</p>
<p> The <a href="../ui/Animation.html">animation control</a> buttons are available
  in either case:</p>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/AnimButtons.gif"  alt="images/AnimButtons.gif" ></div>
<p>To increase precision using the sounding diagram, enlarge the window by dragging
  on the edges. You can zoom the sounding diagram by holding down the Shift key
  and dragging the right button upwards; drag downwards to zoom out. You can
  pan the diagram by dragging the mouse pointer in any direction while pressing
  the right mouse button.</p>
<p> The temperature and dew-point traces can be modified via the cursor. Press
  the left button on the first data-point to be modified and drag it horizontally
  along an isobar to the desired position, then move the pointer diagonally along
  an isotherm to keep the data-point at the desired position and to pick-up the
  next data-point. Repeat until done and then release the mouse button.</p>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Aerological Parameters</div>
<p>The table to the left of the sounding diagram contains aerological parameters
determined from the atmospheric sounding displayed in the diagram. The following
abbreviations are used:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>LCL</dt>
  <dd> Lifting Condensation Level: the level at which a pseudo-adiabatically
    lifted air-parcel becomes saturated with water-vapor. </dd>
  <dt>LFC</dt>
  <dd> Level of Free Convection: the level at which the virtual temperature of
    a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel changes from being less than the
    environment's virtual temperature to being greater than the environment's. </dd>
  <dt>LNB</dt>
  <dd> Level of Neutral Buoyancy: the level above the LFC at which the virtual
    temperature of a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel equals the environment's
    virtual temperature. </dd>
  <dt>CAPE</dt>
  <dd> Convective Available Potential Energy: the area between the virtual temperature
    trace of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel and the virtual temperature
    trace of the environment from the LFC to the LNB in which the parcel's virtual
    temperature is greater than the environment's (positive CAPE connotes convective
    development).</dd>
  <dt>CIN</dt>
  <dd> Convective Inhibition: the negative of the area between the virtual temperature
    trace of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel and the virtual temperature
    trace of the environment from the parcel's initial conditions to the LFC
    in which the parcel's virtual temperature is less than the environment's
    (negative CIN connotes initial positive work to lift the parcel). </dd>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Soundings</strong></li>
    <p>When displaying multiple sounding locations, use the pull down menu to
      select a station to display.</p>
	<p></p>
  <li><strong>Parcel Path</strong></li>
    <p>When checked, displays the path of a parcel of air lifted pseudo-adiabatically
      from the initial point to the top of the diagram.</p>
	<p></p>
  <li><strong>Virtual Temperature</strong></li>
    <p>When checked, the virtual temperatures of the environmental profile and
      pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel are displayed.</p>
	<p></p>
  <li><strong>Grid Points</strong></li>
    <p>When checked, turns on the display of the grid points in the main display.</p>
	<p></p>
  <li><strong>Stations</strong></li>
    <p>Toggle the visibility of the RAOB station location mark in the main display
      window.</p>
	<p></p>
  <li><strong>Parcel mode</strong></li>
    <p>Use the pull down menu to specify how the initial conditions of the pseudo-adiabatically
      lifted air-parcel (i.e. the parcel's pressure, temperature, and moisture
      content at the start of the pseudoadiabatic lifting) are determined from
      the environmental sounding (i.e. the temperature and dew-point profiles
      according to the mode indicated. The choices are: </p>
	  <p></p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>Bottom of Sounding</strong> - The initial conditions of the
	      parcel are determined from the temperature and dew-point at the lowest
        (i.e. highest pressure).</li><p></p>
	    <li><strong>Below Cursor</strong> - The initial conditions of the parcel
	      are determined from the temperature and dew-point profiles by computing
	      the pressure-weighted mean potential temperature and water-vapor mixing-ratio
	      of the atmosphere that lies below the cursor when the middle mouse
	      button is pressed. Thus, pressing the middle button at 950 hPa for a sounding
	      that starts at 1000 hPa will effectively mix the lower 50 hPa of the
	      atmosphere and lift the resulting parcel starting at 975 hPa.</li><p></p>
	    <li><strong>At Cursor Pressure</strong> - The initial pressure, in-situ
	      temperature, and moisture content of the parcel are taken from the
	      temperature and dew-point profiles at the pressure of the cursor when
	      the middle mouse button is pressed. In <b>At Cursor (Press, Temp)</b> mode,
	      the initial pressure and in-situ temperature of the parcel equal the pressure
	      and temperature values under the cursor when the middle mouse button is
	      pressed. The initial moisture content is determined from the dew-point
	      profile at the initial pressure.</li><p></p>
	    <li><strong>At Cursor (Press, Temp)</strong> - The computed path of a lifted
	      parcel is automatically updated when appropriate. In both <b>Below Cursor</b>, <b>At
	      Cursor Pressure</b>, and <b>At Cursor (Press, Temp)</b> modes, the path
	      will update as the cursor is dragged. In all modes, the path will update
        whenever the profiles change.</li>
		<p></p>
	  </ul>
  <li><strong>Wind spacing</strong></li>
    <p>Allows the user to control which wind levels are shown in the display.</p>
	<p></p>
  <li><strong>Reset Sounding</strong></li>
    <p>Resets the temperature and dewpoint profiles back to their original values. </p>
