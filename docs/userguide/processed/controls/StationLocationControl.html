<div class="pagesubtitle">Overview</div>

The IDV provides a collection of locations. These may
be NEXRAD stations, states, counties, geographical features,
countries, etc. The Location Control is used to display
these locations.
The list of locations is accessed through the 
<code class="menu">Displays-&gt;Locations-&gt;...</code> menu.
<p><p>The user interface consists of four tabs. The first allows the user
to control the display.  <p><div class="cimg"><img  src="images/StationLocationControlGui.gif"  alt="images/StationLocationControlGui.gif" ></div>

The second tab shows two sub-tabs that list all the locations and
the currently displayed locations.  At the bottom is shown the details
of any locations that have been clicked on in the main display
(turned off with the <code class="menu">Listen for clicks</code> button)
or have been selected in the lists.  You can
Shift-Click and Control-Click on a location in the list
to center and zoom in/out in the main display. Turn off this behavior
with the <code class="menu">Center on Selected</code> check box. 

<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/StationLocationControlGui2.gif"  alt="images/StationLocationControlGui2.gif" ></div>

The <code class="button">Data Sets</code>  tab lists all of the location  
files that are being displayed. 
You can add new locations with the <code class="menu">Edit-&gt;Add Locations</code> menu.
You can remove a set of locations by selecting the location entry in the
list and pressing the &quot;delete&quot; key.

<p>

The <code class="button">Filters</code>  tab allows you  to filter what locations are being
shown based on their internal attributes. There is more information
about the filter mechanism in the documentation for
the <a href="StationModelControl.html">Point Data Plot Control</a>.



<div class="pagesubtitle">Properties</div><ul><li><b>Declutter</b><p> 
Click off the <code class="command">Declutter</code> checkbox to see all locations.
The display otherwise shows only selected locations that do
not overlap.  As you zoom or pan in the display different locations
will be shown. When decluttering is turned on you can change the density level
of the locations. The small &quot;lock&quot; button allows you to
fix the currently displayed/decluttered locations. Using the lock button
allows you to zoom or pan without changing what locations are displayed.
 <p>
<li><b>Display</b><p> 
The display of the locations can be done through a fixed
specification of a symbol and/or and identifier as well
as by using one of the station models available.
<p>
Use the options in the <code class="command">Identifier</code> panel to control
what station information is displayed.  Use the <code class="command">Visible</code>
checkbox to toggle the visibility of the identifier in the
plot.
Use the options in the <code class="command">Symbol</code> panel to control
what marker symbol is displayed.  Clicking an item will
immediately change the display.  Use the <code class="command">Visible</code>
checkbox to toggle the visibility of the symbol in the
plot.
<p>
When you select the <code class="command">Layout Model</code> radio button
the station model facility is used to display the location.
You can edit and/or create new station models. 
The predefined &quot;Location&quot; station model is a good one to
use for display and as a basis to create your own.
 <p>
<li><b>Vertical Position</b><p> 
You can choose to display the locations at their altitude (if there is one)
or you can override this and specifically define the vertical position.
