A number of the display controls make use of a charting facility. The charts
have a common set of properties and facilities.

Each of these display controls will show a thumbnail image of their charts
in the legend. This can be toggled using the <code class="menu">View-&gt;Chart-&gt;Show Chart Thumbnail</code> menu.<p>There are  three levels of configuration available to the user.

<a name="chartlines"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">5.8.0 Chart Line Properties</div> <p>At the lowest level you can set the properties of how each parameter or
field is shown.  This is done through the Chart Line properties dialog which
is brought up typically through the <code class="menu">View-&gt;Chart</code> menu or by right clicking
on the fields table.

<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/ChartLineProperties.gif"  alt="images/ChartLineProperties.gif" ></div>

This properties  dialog allows you to set the visibility of the line (<code class="menu">Full Plot</code>)
as well as the whether the axis label is shown. You can also specify a different <code class="menu">Chart Name</code>
by selecting one from the pull-down list or typing one into the field. 
This is how you create new charts. The display will automatically create a new chart with the given name.
You can also specify what side of the chart the axis is shown. The
<code class="menu">Range</code> fields allow you to fix the axis range. That way as the chart values change the axis
range is maintained constant.

There are a number of settings for the actual display of the line. It can be a line, area, shape, etc.
You can also set the line stroke, width and color.
The <code class="menu">Vertical Position</code> menu allows you to define where in the chart special shapes
are shown (e.g., wind barbs, cloud coverage, text).<p><a name="chartproperties"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">5.8.1 Chart Properties</div> 
For each chart there are a number of settings that can be changed through the
Chart Properties dialog. This is also accessed through the <code class="menu">View-&gt;Chart</code> 
menu or by right clicking on the chart. 

<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/ChartProperties.gif"  alt="images/ChartProperties.gif" ></div>
You can change the name of the chart and set its background color and domain/range line 
properties.  

When right clicking on a chart you can also zoom in and out and write the chart as an image.
There are also a number of key and mouse bindings on the chart:
<ul>
<li> Control-R: Reset any zooming.
<li> Up/Down/Left/Right Arrows: Pan
p<li> Left mouse drag - zoom
</ul><p><a name="chartlayout"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">5.8.2 Chart Layout</div> 
When you have multiple charts you can define different layouts for them
using the <code class="menu">View-&gt;Chart-&gt;Layout</code> menu. There are a number of
pre-defined layouts: Vertical, Horizontal, 2 Column, 3 Column, Tabs.
The Grid Layout allows for much flexibility in how the charts are organized
and laid out. The <code class="menu">View-&gt;Chart-&gt;Layout-&gt;Change Grid Layout</code> menu
brings up the Grid Layout Editor:
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/GridLayoutEditor.gif"  alt="images/GridLayoutEditor.gif" ></div>

The idea here is the overall window is divided up into a number of rows and columns. You can
add/remove rows and columns with the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;  buttons.
You can then drag the little graphical representations of the charts to place
them in the grid. A chart can also span multiple rows or columns. Just grab
the little black square on one side of the chart image and drag it to change the
row or column.<p><p>
