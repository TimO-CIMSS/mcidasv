<h3>The McIDAS-V User's Guide is currently under construction to develop a more detailed and accurate guide.  Some screenshots are out-of-date, but the current content is accurate.</h3>
<p> McIDAS-V is a <b>free</b>, open source, visualization and data analysis software
  package that is the next generation in SSEC's 35-year history of sophisticated
  McIDAS software packages. McIDAS-V displays weather satellite (including hyperspectral)
  and other geophysical data in 2- and 3-dimensions. McIDAS-V can also analyze
  and manipulate the data with its powerful mathematical functions. McIDAS-V
  is built on SSEC's VisAD and Unidata's IDV libraries, and contains &quot;Bridge&quot; software
  that enables McIDAS-X users to run their commands and tasks in the McIDAS-V
  environment. A future version of McIDAS-V will contain an integrated version
  of SSEC's HYDRA software package.</p> <a name="image1"></a>

This McIDAS-V User's Guide is currently under construction. Once completed, it
will describe using the features available in the McIDAS-V application. For a
brief description about getting started using McIDAS-V and making displays of
common data available, refer to the <a href="./quickstart/">Getting Started</a> section.
<p> The McIDAS-V software library can be easily be used and extended to create
  custom geoscience applications beyond the atmospheric science realm. This customization
  allows new applications to be tailored to specific datasets and provide customized
  user interfaces for different tasks.</p>
<p> Development of McIDAS-V is ongoing at the Space Science and Engineering Center
  (SSEC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The development is driven by
  the needs of the community of users. Suggestions, comments, and collaboration
  are welcomed and encouraged. The goal is to provide new and innovative ways
  of displaying and analyzing Earth science data, as well as provide common displays
  that many users have come to expect.</p>
