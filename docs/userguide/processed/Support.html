and formats for use in the IDV, and sharing of IDV based materials      
(bundles, educational materials, etc). This list is used by the Unidata

developers who are using IDV source code to build customized or         
new IDV-based applications. The software developers of the IDV are      
subscribers to this list and may be able to help with questions about   
use of the IDV software framework.
