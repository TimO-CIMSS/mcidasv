<div class="pagetitle">1.2 Downloading and Running the IDV</div>



<b>Please be sure to read about 
<a href="Systems.html">System Requirements</a> before trying
to run the IDV applications.</b>


<p>

Unidata provides four ways to download and run the IDV reference
application.  If you have a reasonably fast Internet connection, 
any method should get the IDV running on your system in less than 
15 minutes.  Little or no setup or configuration is required.  About 
70 megabytes of disk space are needed for all the software.
<p>
If you have any trouble downloading and installing the IDV, 
first check the <a href="Faq.html">FAQ</a>, then please report 
your problem as described in <a href="Support.html">
Support from Unidata</a>.

<p>

The 4 ways to install the IDV on your machine are:

<a name="installers"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">1.2.0 
IDV Installers</div> 


The IDV installers are self extracting programs which include
the IDV reference application, the required Java runtime environment,
and Java3D.  You do not need to have Java or Java3D installed previously
on your system. Even if you already have some version of Java on your
system, using the installer ensures that you use the IDV with a recent
version of Java and Java 3D that works with the IDV.

<p>

First, download the single installer file for your operating system from:

<ul>
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/idv/latest">
<b>http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/idv/latest</b>
</a>
</ul>

<p> Find the installer for your particular operating system and click on
the link to save it to your system. If you are not prompted to download
automatically, then use the right mouse button and choose the menu
option to save the file to your system (On Internet Explorer select menu
option "Save Target As..." On Netscape Navigator select menu option
"Save Link As...")</p>


<p>The file sizes are about 50 megabytes. When expanded
during installation, the total disk space needed is about 90 to 100
megabytes.</p>

<p>

Once the file has been downloaded, run the installer:

<ul>

<li>On <b>Windows and Mac OS-X</b>, use the system browser 
to go to the directory where the file was downloaded,
then click on the file icon to start the installer. Follow the
instructions in the installer's pop-up window. Once the IDV is
installed, you can start it by clicking on the icon or link created
during installation.</li><p>


<li>On <b>Unix</b>, run the installer with sh (installer
file name), (e.g., <b>sh idv_2_4_linux-i386_installer.sh</b>) in
the directory where you saved this file. Follow the instructions in
the installer's pop-up window. Once the IDV is installed, go to the
directory you selected and type <b>./runIDV</b> to start the IDV.
</li><p>
</ul>

<h4>Unattended installations</h4>
The installers can be run in a quiet, unattended mode which does
not show the installation screens nor require input from the
user.  In this mode, the default settings are selected.  The
user can only override the installation directory in this mode.
To run the installer in an unattended mode, pass the &quot;-q&quot;
parameter to the installer. For example, to run the following:<p>
<pre>
<b>sh idv_2_4_linux-i386_installer.sh -q</b>
</pre>

To run the Windows installer in quite mode and override the default
installation directory, open a command window, change to the
directory where you saved the installer and type:
<pre>
<b>idv_2_4_windows_installer -q -dir "c:\myidv"</b>
</pre>



<a name="webstart"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">1.2.1 
Using Java Web Start</div> 


<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/"> Java Web Start</a>
is an application-deployment technology from Sun Microsystems that downloads
all necessary software for an application and then starts the application
with a single click in your Web browser.

<p>

One advantage of Web Start is that it will install the program
on the first download and will automatically check
for updates and retrieve new versions on subsequent start-ups. 
New releases of the IDV are common, so this can save you the trouble
of manually retrieving new versions.

<p>

Web Start has a disadvantage that you have to first install
Web Start.  Web Start is included in the latest (1.5+) releases
of Java for Windows, OS-X, Linux and Solaris. Follow the instructions on
the link above for your specific platform.

<p>

Unidata has a web page to help you download and start the IDV
with Web Start:

<p>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/webstart/IDV/">
<b>http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/webstart/IDV/</b>
</a>
</ul>

<p>

For more control of programs run with Web Start, use the 
Web Start Application Manager. Go to:<p>
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/webstart/IDV/player.jnlp">
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/webstart/IDV/player.jnlp</a>
<p>
You should see the IDV in the Application Manager's panel.
Do this after you have installed Web Start and installed the IDV with
Web Start.  

<p>

For more about use of Web Start with the IDV see the 
<A HREF="Faq.html">IDV FAQ</A>.  </p>




<a name="manual"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">1.2.2 Downloading files manually</div> 

If your platform does not support Web Start or if you wish to run
the IDV without Web Start and have more control over how and where the
application is installed and starts, the following instructions will
allow you to run it from a command line.  You must have Java and Java
3D installed on your system already.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the necessary Java Archive (JAR) files from<p>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/idv/latest">
<b>http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/idv/latest</b>
</a>
</ul>

<p>

Download <b>IDV 2.5a1 JAR Files</b>(idv_jars_2.5a1.zip) from that page.
</li>

<p>

<li>Unzip the JARs into a directory on your disk.</li>

<p>

<li>From that directory, run:<p>

<pre>
   java -Xmx512m -jar idv.jar
</pre>

<p>

<li>From the command line, the IDV supports several options
that allow you to override the default behavior (e.g. load
in a particular data set or bundle at start-up).  For a 
complete list of options, run:
<pre>
   java -jar idv.jar -help
</pre>
</ol>

</p>
<br>



<div class="pagesubtitle">Running the IDV</div>

When you have successfully downloaded and started the IDV, 
a splash screen appears as the IDV starts up. This will disappear
once the application is running:

<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/Splash.gif"  alt="images/Splash.gif" ></div>


<a name="source"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">1.2.3 
Downloading the IDV Source Code and Javadoc</div> 

The latest snapshot of the IDV source code and associated 
Javadoc files are also available at:

<p>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/idv">
<b>http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/idv</b>
</a>
</ul>

<p>

The files are:

<ul>

<p>

IDV 2.5a1 Source Code (idv_src_2.5a1.jar) 

<p>

IDV 2.5a1 Javadocs (idv_javadoc_2.5a1.jar)

</ul>

<a href="misc/SourceBuild.html">Building the IDV from Source</a>
document.
