<div class="pagetitle">Bundles</div>
Bundles let you save a quick &quot;snapshot&quot; of McIDAS-V, including data sources,
maps, data displays. Bundles are small information files that specify the state
of McIDAS-V. They are a kind of configuration file. They include information
about what data sources are in use, and which parameters from the data sources
are displayed, and how they are displayed.
<p> The purpose of bundles is for you to save a particular McIDAS-V setup and
  display. A bundle can be used for your own reference at a later time. Others
  using McIDAS-V can use bundles you made to see data the same way you did.</p>
<p> To make a new bundle file select the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save As</code> menu.
  A pop-up window will let you set a new file location and name:</p> 
  <a name="image1"></a>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/FileDialog.gif"  alt="Bundle File Dialog" ><br>
  <span class="caption">Image 1: Bundle File Dialog</span></div>
The customary McIDAS-V bundle filename extension is <b>.mcv</b>; if you do not
enter a file extension, .mcv will be appended. You may use any other file extension
you like.
<p> Note: For bundle files to work the data must be available in exactly the
  same way you made connection to it when you made the bundle file. Others who
  use your bundles must have access to the same file system or to the same remote
  or local data servers you use, so that file paths or URLs to the data are exactly
  the same.</p>
<p> The file dialog has a set of buttons on the right that allow you to save
  off (or not save off) different components of the McIDAS-V state.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The <code class="menu">Views</code> button is related to the windows and
    views.</li>
  <li> Checking off the <code class="menu">Displays</code> button will not include
    any of the created displays.</li>
  <li> The <code class="menu">Data Sources</code> button allows for you to not
    include any of the data sources. When reading in a bundle that had been saved
    without data sources and with displays McIDAS-V will prompt the user for
    the data to be used. For example, you can create a set of displays of a gridded
    data set (e.g., Temperature, Relative Humidity, etc.) This state can be saved
    off without the data sources. When you load this bundle back in again McIDAS-V
    will prompt the user for the required data fields. This allows you to essentially
    save off a display template that can be used for different data sets.</li>
  <li> The <code class="menu">Jython</code> menu allows you to save off in different
    ways the Jython code you may have in your library. Say for example you have
    written some custom Jython code that implements a Formula. You have a display
    that uses the results of that computation. To include your local Jython code
    just select <code class="menu">All Jython</code> or <code class="menu">Selected
    Jython</code>. When loading in a bundle that has had Jython code saved with
    it the user will be prompted for what to do with the Jython.</li>
  <li> <a name="relative"></a> One can save a bundle with data paths that are
    relative to where the bundle is loaded from by checking the <code class="menu">Save
    with relative paths</code> checkbox. McIDAS-V will change the file based
    data sources to point to the directory where the bundle is loaded from. For
    example, you can use this to save a bundle that references model files on
    disk. Copy the bundle and the model files over to a thumb drive or CD. Then
    when you load the bundle the files are relative to the bundle path.</li>
  <li> The <code class="menu">Enable user to change data</code> button, when
    checked, will configure the bundle so that when it is loaded the user will
    be able to change the file paths or URLS that point to data sets.</li>
</ul>
<a name="open"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Opening a Bundle</div>
Use the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Open File </code> menu to open a bundle.
When loading in a new bundle you will be prompted whether the current displays
and data should be removed. You can also start up McIDAS-V with a bundle file
or URL in the command line. <a name="jnlp"></a>
<!--<div class="pagesubtitle">JNLP Bundles</div>
You can also save a bundle inside a &quot;jnlp file&quot; that can be used to
start McIDAS-V with the bundle. Use a filename extension of &quot;.jnlp&quot; in
place of .xidv. This file, when used as a link on a regular web page, allows
McIDAS-V users to start McIDAS-V with Web Start on their system with your bundle.
Click on the link to your jnlp file. McIDAS-V will start with the bundle you
saved in the .jnlp file.--> <a name="default"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">The Default Bundle</div>
Select the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save Bundle-&gt;As Default</code> menu
to create a bundle that is read whenever you start McIDAS-V. This will provide
a standard starting configuration. You can set up the geographic area, map projection,
and maps you prefer, for example. <a name="favorites"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Favorite Bundles</div>
Favorite bundles are just normal bundles that are categorized and saved off in
a particular location on disk and serve as a convenience to the user. This allows
the user to organize their favorites by category and readily load them in.
<p> Favorite bundles come in two forms: as regular bundles and as favorite data
  sources.</p>
<p> A regular favorite bundle can be created through the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save
    Bundle </code><code class="menu">-&gt;As Favorite ...</code> menus. The &quot;Save
    As Favorite&quot; dialog is shown:</p> 
<a name="image2"></a>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/SaveAsFavorite.gif"  alt="Save As Favorite Dialog" ><br>
  <span class="caption">Image 2: Save As Favorite Dialog</span></div>
A favorite bundle has a category which can be entered in the <code class="menu">Category</code> field.
Categories can be hierarchical, using a &quot;&gt;&quot; as separator. For example: &quot;Toolbar&gt;sounding&quot; The &quot;Toolbar&quot; category
is special. These will result in links in the toolbar. After specifying a category
specify a Name for the favorite bundle.
<!--<p> The Display Templates favorites are created through the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save
    Display as Favorite</code> menu. This allows you to create a display as you
    like (e.g., a Contour Plan View at a certain level with certain settings),
    save it off and recreate it later. Display Templates for displays that showed
    data will show up in the Displays component of the Field Selector.</p>
<p> Data Source favorites are created through the Data Source popup menu in the
  Field Selector.</p> -->
<p> Bundles can be with managed with the Favorites Manager:</p> 
<a name="image3"></a>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/FavoritesManager.gif"  alt="Favorites Manager" ><br>
  <span class="caption">Image 3: Favorites Manager</span></div>
This is brought through the <code class="menu">
Bundles-&gt;Manage...</code>, menu. The Favorites Manager allows you to reorganize
the categories and favorites by drag-and-drop. You can also right click on a
favorite or a category to delete it, export, etc. <a name="zidv"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Data in Bundles</div>
McIDAS-V supports a bundle format: .mcvz (or zipped mcv). This is a zip file
that contains a regular bundle (mcv) and a set of data files. When the user
does a &quot;Save As...&quot; and specifies a .mcv file extension McIDAS-V prompts
the user to select the data sources that should be written into the zip file.
On opening a zidv file McIDAS-V needs to unzip the data files so it prompts the
user as to where to place the files - a temporary directory or a user selected
directory (this is a preference as well).
<p> For most remote data types, data can be copied from the server to the local
  disk using the &quot;Make Remote Data Local&quot; facility. The following ADDE
  types are supported: satellite, radar, point, sounding and forecast fronts.
  There is also preliminary support for grids on remote servers<sup>*</sup> (see
  below).</p>
<p> This is used in two ways. First, the user can right click on a data source
  in the Field Selector and select &quot;Make Data Local&quot; for remote data
  sources. McIDAS-V prompts for a file directory and a file prefix (the default
  is to use the name of the data source) and the remote data is  copied over.
  For multiple files the format used is: &lt;directory&gt;&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;file
  count&gt;.&lt;suffix&gt;.
  The data source object within McIDAS-V is then changed to point to the new
  file paths.</p>
<p> The second way this is used is when  a zidv file is saved. The user is
  prompted for both the local data sources to be saved off as well as for the
  remote data sources. For the remote ones McIDAS-V automatically copies the
  files over and zips them up.</p>
<p><strong><sup>*</sup>Grids:</strong> There is preliminary support for grids. This support relies on some
  extra service information in the catalogs which, right at this moment, is not
  included in the regular IDV gridded data catalog but is included for model
  data under the &quot;File_Access&quot; dataset
  in the main motherlode catalog: http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/catalog.xml</p>
<p> When saving gridded data the user is prompted for the fields to save and
  the geo-spatial subset is used to subset the grids. As of right now, there
  is not yet support for sub-setting on times and grid stride/decimation.</p>
<div class="pagesubtitle">IDV Bundles</div>
<p>McIDAS-V also support the ability to load and save IDV bundles (.xidv and .zidv).</p>
