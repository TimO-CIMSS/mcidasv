<div class="pagesubtitle">Introduction</div>
<p>The Color Table Editor supports editing existing color tables and creating
  new ones. A color table is an ordered collection of colors that is used to
  color a display according to a range of data values.</p>
  <div class="images"><img src="images/colortable/Main.gif" alt="images/colortable/Main.gif"></div>
<a name="intro" id="intro"></a>
<p></p>
<p><a name="starting" id="starting"></a></p>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Starting the Color Table Editor</div>
The Color Table Editor can be used stand-alone by selecting the <strong>Tools-&gt;Color
Tables</strong> menu item from the main menu bar. It can also be used or in conjunction
with a particular display by clicking on the display's color bar in the <a href="../controls/index.html#legends">legend</a>,
or through the display's <a href="../controls/index.html#menus">edit menu</a>.
When used in conjunction with a particular display the changes you make to the
color table are applied to the display as you make them. To turn this off use
the <strong>Auto Update</strong> check box in the lower right corner
of the window.
<p>The Color Table Editor starts with a color table loaded in it. If you are
  working with a data display, the color table in the editor is the same as in
  the display. If you want to use or edit a different color table, use the <strong>Color
  Tables</strong> menu to select from the categorized list of color tables:</p>
<div class="images"><img src="images/ColorTablesMenu.gif" alt="images/ColorTablesMenu.gif"></div>
<p>Color tables are grouped into categories, as illustrated. The illustration
  shows the color tables for the &quot;Basic&quot; category. Click on a category and
  then on a &quot;color table to select.</p>
<p>To switch to the newly selected color table for a display on screen, click
  on <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom of the Color Table Editor, and the editor
  will close, or click on <strong>Apply</strong> to keep the editor in use. If <strong>Auto
  Update</strong> is checked the change takes place without further action by you,
  as soon as you select a new color table.</p>
<a name="legend" id="legend"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Color Legend</div>
<div class="images"><img src="images/colortable/Legend.gif" alt="images/colortable/Legend.gif"></div>
<p>The color table is shown in the bar of color across the window, the color
  legend. How many colors are in the table is shown in a label in the upper center,
  such as &quot;135 colors.&quot; You can reduce or increase the number of colors by clicking
  on the <strong>-/+</strong> choices near the left and right ends of the legend.
  New colors are added or removed at each end of the legend with the same color
  as the end color. Pressing Shift-Click on any of these buttons will add/remove
  10 color slots at a time. </p>
<p>Underneat the color legend is a black and white checker board to help show
  the degree of transparency. Most color tables have zero transparency and the
  checker board is not visible.</p>
<p>The <strong>History</strong> undo/redo buttons in the upper left allow you
  to step forward and backward through the changes you have made. Pressing Shift-Click
  on these buttons will step forward/back 10 changes. </p>
<p>The spectrum of colors spans a range of data values. The values are shown
  at the ends of the color legends. You can change the max and min of the range
  with the <strong>Range:</strong> pair of dialog boxes on the right. Enter the
  minimum and maximum values of the range you need, and click Apply or Ok, or
  press the Enter key. If the Color Table Editor is being used in conjunction
  with a display then when you change the range that range is applied to the
  display as well.</p>
<a name="painting" id="painting"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Painting and Editing Colors</div>
<p>You can &quot;paint&quot; in the color bar by just dragging the mouse within
  it. When your mouse is over the color bar the cursor will change to a paintbrush
  and a gray line is drawn to indicate the position of the cursor.</p>
<p>The type of painting is specified by the Paint Mode buttons. </p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Fill</strong>. When you drag
it will fill the color table with the currently chosen
color in the color chooser.</li>
<li> <strong>Interpolate</strong>. Apply  a linear interpolation 
from where you started dragging the breakpoint to the color value of 
where the breakpoint is currently  at while dragging.</li>
<li> <strong>Transparency</strong>. Apply the given transparency
value (in the editable pull down menu) to the color table where
you are dragging the breakpoint.</li>
</ul>
<a name="breakpoints" id="breakpoints"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Breakpoints</div>
<p>The editor uses &quot;breakpoints&quot; indicated along the top of the color legend
  bar with little triangles and a number. Clicking on a break point makes it
  active. The number on an active breakpoint is in <strong>bold</strong> characters.
  There is only one active breakpoint at a time. Making a new breakpoint makes
  the new breakpoint active.</p>
<p>Breakpoints are used for a number of things: showing the data and transparency
  values at a point along the color table and changing the colors (fill, interpolation
  or transparency) directly below the breakpoint by dragging the breakpoint and
  changing colors through a popup menu.</p>
<p>The values on the breakpoints are determined by the position of the breakpoint
  along the legend, proportional to the min and max of the Range. Changing the
  minimum and maximum of the Range changes the break point values.</p>
<p>You can move the active breakpoint several ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drag on it with the mouse pointer;</li>
  <li>Move in small increments with the right or left arrow keys. (If there is
    no response, first mouse click on the breakpoint.)</li>
  <li>Move in bigger steps with the shift-arrow keys.</li>
  <li>Right-click on the breakpoint and use the pop-up menu item <strong>Change
      Breakpoint</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the &quot;Actively set color&quot; checkbox selected, when you change the
  color in the color chooser at the bottom that color will be applied to the
  color slot under the selected breakpoint. This allows you to set the color
  of a specific color slot. </p>
<p>You can also change colors and manipulate breakpoints using a right mouse
  click popup menu on a breakpoint:</p>
<div class="images"><img src="images/colortable/BreakpointsChoice.gif" alt="images/colortable/BreakpointsChoice.gif"></div>
<p></p>
The choices are:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Remove Breakpoint</strong>.</li>
  <li style="list-style: none">Remove the active breakpoint.</li>
  <li><strong>Change Breakpoint</strong>.</li>
  <li style="list-style: none">Set the breakpoint value.</li>

<div class="pagesubtitle">Saving, Importing and Exporting</div>
You can modify an existing color table, or edit an existing color table and save
it with a new name to make a new color table. Any new or modified color table
can be saved for future use.
<p>To save a new or modified color table simply select the the <strong>File-&gt;Save</strong> menu
  item or <strong>Save</strong> button. To save a modified color table
  as a new color table, select <strong>File-&gt;Save As</strong> and
  enter the new name in the dialog box that appears. This new color table will
  now be permanently saved in your local collection of color tables.</p>
<p>To save a color table as a file which can be shared with others in their McIDAS-V,
  select the <strong>File-&gt;Export</strong> menu item. A file dialog
  will appear that will allow you to save the color table as an XML-format file.
  We suggest you use a file extension of <strong>.xidvct</strong>.</p>
<p>To use a color table as a file which has been supplied to you by another McIDAS-V
  user, select the <strong>File-&gt;Import</strong> menu item. A file
  dialog will appear that will allow you to find the color table as an XML-format
  file. The following types of color tables can be imported: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>McIDAS-V (IDV) color tables (*.xml)</li>
  <li>GEMPAK color tables (*.tbl)</li>
  <li>McIDAS-X color tables (*.ET)</li>
  <li> 3-column RGB color table (*.ascii)</li>
  </ul>
<div class="pagesubsubtitle">3-column RGB color table</div>
<p>The definitions of the 3-column RGB color table are divided over a range of
  values. Each line represents one of the equal sized blocks on the color bar.
  If there are ten lines in the file, they show up on the color bar as ten equal-sized
  blocks, with the first line's color being applied to the first block, the second
  line's color applied to the second, etc. Currently, there needs to be five
  or more lines in the file in order for the color table to work.</p>
<a name="chooser" id="chooser"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Color Chooser</div>
<a name="image1" id="image1"></a>
<div class="images"><img src="images/colorchooser/ColorChooser.gif" alt="The Color Chooser, HSB panel"> <br>
  <span class="caption">Image 1: The Color Chooser, HSB panel</span></div>
<p>The Color Chooser, in the lower half of the Color Table Editor window, allows
  you to select any possible color.
</p>
<p>There are two tabs on the chooser, <strong>HSB</strong> and <strong>RGB</strong>,
  each with its own control panels. The RGB panel shows a window that lets you
  specify any color by slider bars for R, G, and B values. R, G, and B are red-green-blue
  settings that control the intensity of the color guns in a CRT. The only color
  sample of an RGB value is the color of the active breakpoint in the legend,
  which can be pretty small and hard to see clearly. Also, RGB values are not
  intuitive -- to get yellow you mix equal amounts of red and green in RGB. We
  recommend you use the HSB chooser panel unless you have specific RGB values
  to set.</p>
<h4>The HSB Chooser</h4>
<p>The HSB chooser allows you to control color by hue, saturation, and brightness,
  thereby making any color. With the HSB panel and tab shown, click on one of
  the circles marked <strong>H</strong>, <strong>S</strong> , or <strong>B</strong> for
  the corresponding control for hue, saturation, or brightness.</p>
<p>Hue is the term indicating a pure color selection from the spectrum. Saturation
  is an indication of how much white is added to the hue. 100% saturation is
  pure hue with no white. Brightness is an indication of how much black is added
  to the hue. 100% brightness has no black and maximum brilliancy, but can be
  any saturation from the hue to pure white. 0% brightness is solid black.</p>
<p>Some &quot;colors&quot; are not found in the spectrum and are a mixture of a hue and
  black or white or both black and white. For example, brown is red-orange and
  some black. Grays are any hue with low saturation and some degree of brightness
  from black to white -- basically a mixture of white and black.</p>
<p>You need only use one of the controls for H, S, or B to make any color. It's
  merely a matter of which one is easiest for you. Often the <strong>H</strong> control
  is the easiest and most intuitive to use. We often think first in terms of
  colors (hues), and next in terms of how pale or dark a color of that hue we
  want. The <strong>H</strong> control works that way. <strong>You can select
  any possible color with the HSB color chooser in the H setting.</strong></p>
<p>All this is easier to understand while using the HSB panel, with <strong>H
    clicked on</strong>:</p>
<p><a name="image2" id="image2"></a>
</p>
<div class="images">
  <p><img src="images/colorchooser/Hue.gif" alt="The HSB Hue chooser, set on green with high S and high B"> <br>
      <span class="caption">Image 2: The HSB Hue chooser, set on green with high
    S and high B</span></p>
</div>
<p>The slider bar chooses the pure hue. Once you have chosen a hue, clicking or
  dragging the mouse on the square color display chooses degrees of saturation
  and brightness -- how much white or black is added in -- for that hue. Using
  the HSB Hue display you can make any color after a little practice.
</p>
<p>Note that the right edge of every hue chooser is a gray scale, and the bottom
  is pure black.</p>
<p>The <strong>Saturation Chooser (S)</strong> has a slider bar with the full
  range of saturation (how much white is added to the color):</p>
<a name="image3" id="image3"></a>
<div class="images"><img src="images/colorchooser/Saturation.gif" alt="The HSB Saturation chooser set on the same green"> <br>
  <span class="caption">Image 3: The HSB Saturation chooser set on the same green</span></div>
<p>Select hue and brightness by dragging the mouse over the colored square.The bottom
  is always solid black. If you want true shades of colors -- pure hue with only
  black and no white -- use the S control with the slider at the top. There are
  no grays or pale colors in this case.
</p>
<p>The <strong>Brightness Chooser (B)</strong> has a slider bar with the full
  range of brightness (how much black is added to the color):</p>
<a name="image4" id="image4"></a>
<div class="images"><img src="images/colorchooser/Brightness.gif" alt="The HSB Brightness chooser set on the same green"> <br>
  <span class="caption">Image 4: The HSB Brightness chooser set on the same green</span></div>
<p>Select hue and saturation by dragging the mouse over the colored square.The bottom
  is always pale gray going to white. If you want to use colors that are all at
  full brightness, use the B control with the slider at the top. Note that colors
  such as brown are not available in this setting, and there are no dark colors.
</p>
<p>All controls in the HSB panel show the RGB values for any color selected,
  in case you need to know the RGB values for another use.</p>
