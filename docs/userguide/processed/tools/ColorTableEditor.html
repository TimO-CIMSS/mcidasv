<div class="pagesubtitle">6.2.0 Introduction</div>
The Color Table Editor supports editing existing color tables and creating new
ones. A color table is an ordered collection of colors that is used to color
a display according to a range of data values. <a name="starting"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">6.2.1 Starting the Color Table Editor</div>
The Color Table Editor can be used stand-alone by selecting the <code class="menu">Tools-&gt;Color
Table Editor</code> menu item from the main menu bar. It can also be used or
in conjunction with a particular display by clicking on the display's color bar
in the <a href="../controls/index.html#legends">legend</a>, or through the display's <a href="../controls/index.html#menus">edit
menu</a>. When used in conjunction with a particular display the changes you
make to the color table are applied to the display as you make them. To turn
this off use the <code class="menu">Auto Update</code> check box in the lower
right corner of the window.
<p> The Color Table Editor starts with a color table loaded in it. If you are
  working with a data display, the color table in the editor is the same as in
  the display. If you want to use or edit a different color table, use the <code class="menu">Color
  Tables</code> menu to select from the categorized list of color tables:</p>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/ColorTablesMenu.gif"  alt="images/ColorTablesMenu.gif" ></div>
Color tables are grouped into categories, as illustrated. The illustration shows
the color tables for the &quot;Basic&quot; category. Click on a category and then on a
color table to select.
<p> To switch to the newly selected color table for a display on screen, click
  on <b>OK</b> in the bottom of the Color Table Editor, and the editor will close,
  or click on <b>Apply</b> to keep the editor in use. If <code class="menu">Auto
  Update</code> is checked the change takes place without further action by you,
  as soon as you select a new color table.</p> 
  <a name="legend"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">6.2.2 Color Legend and Setting Colors</div>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/colortable/Legend.gif"  alt="images/colortable/Legend.gif" ></div>
The color table is shown in the bar of color across the window, the color legend.
How many colors are in the table is shown in a label in the lower center, such
as &quot;210 colors.&quot; You can reduce or increase the number of colors by clicking
on the <b>-/+</b> choices near the left and right ends of the legend. New colors
are added or removed at each end of the legend with the same color as the end
color.
<p> Under the color legend is a black and white checker board to help show the
  degree of transparency. Most color tables have zero transparency and the checker
  board is not visible.</p>
<p> The <b>History</b> undo/redo buttons in the upper left allow you to step
  forward and backward through the changes you have made.</p>
<p> The spectrum of colors spans a range of data values. The values are shown
  at the ends of the color legends. You can change the max and min of the range
  with the <b>Range:</b> pair of dialog boxes on the right. Enter the minimum
  and maximum values of the range you need, and click Apply or Ok, or press the
  Enter key. If the Color Table Editor is being used in conjunction with a display
  then when you change the range that range is applied to the display as well.</p>
<p> The editor uses &quot;breakpoints&quot; indicated along the top of the color
  legend bar with little triangles and a number. Clicking on a break point makes
  it active. The number on an active breakpoint is in <b>bold</b> characters.
  There is only one active breakpoint at a time. Making a new breakpoint makes
  the new breakpoint active.</p>
<p> Breakpoints are used for a number of things: showing the data value at a
  point along the color table and changing the colors (fill, interpolation or
  transparency) directly below the breakpoint by dragging the breakpoint and
  changing colors through a popup menu.</p>
<p> The values on the breakpoints are determined by the position of the breakpoint
  along the legend, proportional to the min and max of the Range. Changing the
  minimum and maximum of the Range changes the break point values.</p>
<p> You can move the active breakpoint several ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Drag on it with the mouse pointer;</li>
  <li> Move in small increments with the right or left arrow keys. (If there
    is no response, first mouse click on the breakpoint.)</li>
  <li> Move in bigger steps with the shift-arrow keys.</li>
  <li> Right-click on the breakpoint and use the pop-up menu item <code class="menu">Change
      Breakpoint</code> .</li>
</ul>
<p> To change colors by directly moving a breakpoint select the type of change
  you want with the <code class="menu">Edit mode</code> buttons:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code class="menu">Fill</code>. When you drag a breakpoint it will fill
    the color table with the currently chosen color in the color chooser. Note:
    no matter what the edit mode is when you change colors in the color chooser
    that color will be applied to the active breakpoint.</li>
  <li> <code class="menu">Interpolate</code>. Apply a linear interpolation from
    where you started dragging the breakpoint to the color value of where the
    breakpoint is currently at while dragging.</li>
  <li> <code class="menu">Transparency</code>. Apply the given transparency value
    (in the editable pull down menu) to the color table where you are dragging
    the breakpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p> You can also change colors and manipulate breakpoints using a right mouse
  click popup menu on a breakpoint:</p>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/colortable/BreakpointsChoice.gif"  alt="images/colortable/BreakpointsChoice.gif" ></div>
The choices are:
<ul>
  <li> <code class="menu">Remove Breakpoint</code>.</li>
    Remove the active breakpoint.
  <li> <code class="menu">Change Breakpoint</code>.</li>
    Set the breakpoint value.
  <li> <code class="menu">Add Breakpoint-&gt;Here</code>.</li>
    Add a new breakpoint where you clicked on the legend.
  <li> <code class="menu">Add Breakpoint-&gt;At Data Point</code>.</li>
    Add a new breakpoint at a data value. You will be given a dialog box to enter
      the value in.
  <li> <code class="menu">Add Breakpoint-&gt;At Beginning</code>.</li>
    Add a new breakpoint on the left end.
  <li> <code class="menu">Add Breakpoint-&gt;At End</code>.</li>
    Add a new breakpoint on right end.
  <li> <code class="menu">Set Colors-&gt; Interpolate Left</code>.</li>
    Starting with the color at the active breakpoint, interpolate colors to the
      left up to the next breakpoint.
  <li> <code class="menu">Set Colors-&gt;Interpolate Right</code>.</li>
    Starting with the color at the active breakpoint, interpolate colors to the
      right up to the next breakpoint.
  <li> <code class="menu">Set Colors-&gt;Fill Left</code>.</li>
    Starting with the color at the active breakpoint, fill colors to the left
      up to the next breakpoint with that single color.
  <li> <code class="menu">Set Colors-&gt;Fill Right</code>.</li>
    Starting with the color at the active breakpoint, fill colors to the right
      up to the next breakpoint with that single color.
  <li> <code class="menu">Set Colors-&gt;Transparency Left</code>.</li>
    All color table values from the active breakpoint to the next breakpoint
      to the left are set with the transparency value.
  <li> <code class="menu">Set Colors-&gt;Transparency Right</code>.</li>
    All color table values from the active breakpoint to the next breakpoint
      to the right get the transparency value.
</ul>

<div class="pagesubtitle">6.2.3 Saving, Importing and Exporting</div>
You can modify an existing color table, or edit an existing color table and save
it with a new name to make a new color table. Any new or modified color table
can be saved for future use.
<p> To save a new or modified color table simply select the the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save</code> menu
  item or <code class="menu">Save</code> button. To save a modified color table
  as a new color table, select <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save As</code> and
  enter the new name in the dialog box that appears. This new color table will
  now be permanently saved in your local collection of color tables.</p>
<p> To save a color table as a file which can be shared with others in their
  McIDAS-V, select the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Export</code> menu item. A
  file dialog will appear that will allow you to save the color table as an XML-format
  file. We suggest you use a file extension of <b>.xidvct</b>.</p>
<p> To use a color table as a file which has been supplied to you by another
  McIDAS-V user, select the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Import</code> menu item.
  A file dialog will appear that will allow you to find the color table as an
  XML-format file.</p>

<div class="pagesubtitle">6.2.4 Color Chooser</div>
<a name="image1"></a>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/colorchooser/ColorChooser.gif"  alt="The Color Chooser, HSB panel" ><br>
  <span class="caption">Image 1: The Color Chooser, HSB panel</span></div>
The Color Chooser, in the lower half of the Color Table Editor window, allows
you to select any possible color.
<p> There are two tabs on the chooser, <b>HSB</b> and <b>RGB</b>, each with its
  own control panels. The RGB panel shows a window that lets you specify any
  color by slider bars for R, G, and B values. R, G, and B are red-green-blue
  settings that control the intensity of the color guns in a CRT. The only color
  sample of an RGB value is the color of the active breakpoint in the legend,
  which can be pretty small and hard to see clearly. Also, RGB values are not
  intuitive -- to get yellow you mix equal amounts of red and green in RGB. We
  recommend you use the HSB chooser panel unless you have specific RGB values
  to set.</p>
<h4>The HSB Chooser</h4>
<p> The HSB chooser allows you to control color by hue, saturation, and brightness,
  thereby making any color. With the HSB panel and tab shown, click on one of
  the circles marked <b>H</b>, <b>S </b>, or <b>B</b> for the corresponding control
  for hue, saturation, or brightness.</p>
<p> Hue is the term indicating a pure color selection from the spectrum. Saturation
  is an indication of how much white is added to the hue. 100% saturation is
  pure hue with no white. Brightness is an indication of how much black is added
  to the hue. 100% brightness has no black and maximum brilliancy, but can be
  any saturation from the hue to pure white. 0% brightness is solid black.</p>
<p> Some &quot;colors&quot; are not found in the spectrum and are a mixture of a hue and
  black or white or both black and white. For example, brown is red-orange and
  some black. Grays are any hue with low saturation and some degree of brightness
  from black to white -- basically a mixture of white and black.</p>
<p> You need only use one of the controls for H, S, or B to make any color. It's
  merely a matter of which one is easiest for you. Often the <b>H</b> control
  is the easiest and most intuitive to use. We often think first in terms of
  colors (hues), and next in terms of how pale or dark a color of that hue we
  want. The <b>H</b> control works that way. <b>You can select any possible color
  with the HSB color chooser in the H setting.</b></p>
<p> All this is easier to understand while using the HSB panel, with <b>H clicked
    on</b>:</p> 
<a name="image2"></a>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/colorchooser/Hue.gif"  alt="The HSB Hue chooser, set on green with high S and high B" ><br>
  <span class="caption">Image 2: The HSB Hue chooser, set on green with high
  S and high B</span></div>
The slider bar chooses the pure hue. Once you have chosen a hue, clicking or
dragging the mouse on the square color display chooses degrees of saturation
and brightness -- how much white or black is added in -- for that hue. Using
the HSB Hue display you can make any color after a little practice.
<p> Note that the right edge of every hue chooser is a gray scale, and the bottom
  is pure black.</p>
<p> The <b>Saturation Chooser (S)</b> has a slider bar with the full range of
  saturation (how much white is added to the color):</p> 
<a name="image3"></a>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/colorchooser/Saturation.gif"  alt="The HSB Saturation chooser set on the same green" ><br>
  <span class="caption">Image 3: The HSB Saturation chooser set on the same green</span></div>
Select hue and brightness by dragging the mouse over the colored square.The bottom
is always solid black. If you want true shades of colors -- pure hue with only
black and no white -- use the S control with the slider at the top. There are
no grays or pale colors in this case.
<p> The <b>Brightness Chooser (B)</b> has a slider bar with the full range of
  brightness (how much black is added to the color):</p> 
  <a name="image4"></a>
<div class="cimg"><img  src="images/colorchooser/Brightness.gif"  alt="The HSB Brightness chooser set on the same green" ><br>
  <span class="caption">Image 4: The HSB Brightness chooser set on the same green</span></div>
Select hue and saturation by dragging the mouse over the colored square.The bottom
is always pale gray going to white. If you want to use colors that are all at
full brightness, use the B control with the slider at the top. Note that colors
such as brown are not available in this setting, and there are no dark colors.
<p> All controls in the HSB panel show the RGB values for any color selected,
  in case you need to know the RGB values for another use.</p>
